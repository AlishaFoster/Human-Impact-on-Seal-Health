# Human-Impact-on-Seal-Health
Amongst the many joys of San Diego, UC San Diego resides by the ocean-side, and is host to one of the most prolific Marine Biology institutions in the world. With the ever-surrounding presence of the sea, one of the most prominent peculiarities and attractions of La Jolla happen to be the Seals and the Sea Lions, which populate the La Jolla Coves and the Children's Pool. When looking over the general population of Sea Lions and their prevalence, our initial thoughts, were to examine and observe the relationship between Seal/Sea Lion population, and the traction of tourism and vacationing within the San Diego area, and specifically, La Jolla. 
    
However, given the lack of concrete data-sets relating to Seals and Sea-Lions in the greater San Diego area, our focus soon turned to a larger population and area: the Alaskan coastline, where a large density of Sea Lions reside. Thus, we realigned our interests towards the Alaskan Sea Lions, and tracking a relationship between Fishing and its effects on the local Sea Lion populations. To do that, we utilized three separate datasets: one for sea lion population, one for tracking the health of these very sea lions (Morphometrics), and one tracing the Ocean Economy across several different factors (establishments, RealGDP, etc.).

We found that the Seals happen to be most prominently affected by the amount of construction that occurs within these marine spaces, which is strong related with the overall seal population, and the amount of seals killed over time. What most affects seal health happens to be the amount of offshore mineral extraction, and for the future predictors, we mainly must look towards Marine transportation as well as our general conservation efforts (Living resources), if we want these beautiful creatures to continue thriving.
